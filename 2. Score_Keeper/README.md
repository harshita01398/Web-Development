Score Keeper Project: 
It is a simple Score Keeping app dveloped using HTML and JavaScript. It uses DOM through Javascript. It is used to keep track of scores
of two players and tells you who's winning. 


How Does it Work?
You load up the page and initially it tells you're playing to five, which can be changed as per players' requirements. Press player 1 or 2
to increment their respective scores and when either one wins, it's colour changes and you can no longer increment scores. Reload for a
fresh game.
