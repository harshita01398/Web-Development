The Great RGB Color Game: 
It is a color guessing app built with HTML, CSS and using DOM manipulation by javascript. 


How Does it Work?
When page is loaded, six random colored tiles are generated. One of the colors is listed up in the header. If you guess the correct color
color of all the tiles changes to the correct on. Otherwise if you choose a wrong one, that tile disappears. There are two difficulty levels
easy and hard. Also at any time user can choose to start a new game.
